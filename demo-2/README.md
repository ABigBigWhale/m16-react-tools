# Demo-2
The purpose of this demo is to show how to import/export your React components. To run this demo, you'll have to do the following:

- Fork/clone the repository
- Change your directory to this demo (`cd demo-1`), then run `npm install` to install the node modules
- Start the demo by running `npm-start`

This demonstrates the use of leveraging an external module (`underscore`), as well as importing/exporting a custom component (`Circle`).
